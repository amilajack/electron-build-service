# Vultr snapshot is not suitable for creating on demand. Minimum time to restore â€” 3m20s (and can be 4-5 minutes). Not acceptable. Creating snapshot also takes a lot of time.
# DigitalOcean is much better in this aspect. But we cannot use DigitalOcean since Vultr offers twice more memory. Well, creating from scratch took ~ 1m30s. It is ok.
